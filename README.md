# Get_next_line
Here’s a version limited to 350 characters:  ---  This project implements `get_next_line(int fd)`, a function that reads a file line by line with each call. It handles reading incrementally, without loading the entire file into memory. The focus is on static variables, buffer management, and mastering low-level file handling in C.
